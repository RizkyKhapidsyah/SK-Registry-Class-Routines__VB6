REG_BINARY
This is the raw binary data. Most hardware component information is stored as binary data,
and can be displayed in Registry Editor in hexadecimal format, or displayed in WinMSD 
in an easy-to-read format. For example: 
			   Component Information : REG_BINARY : 00 00 00... 
REG_DWORD
This is data represented by a number that is four bytes long. Many parameters for 
device driver and services are this type, and can be displayed in Registry Editor in binary,
hexadecimal, or decimal format. For example, entries for service error controls 
are this type: 
		   	   ErrorControl : REG_DWORD : 0x1 

REG_EXPAND_SZ
An expandable data string that is text containing a variable to be 
replaced when called by an application. For example, for the following value, 
the string "%SystemRoot%" will replaced by the actual location of the directory 
containing the Windows NT system files: 
			   File : REG_EXPAND_SZ : %SystemRoot%\file.exe 

REG_MULTI_SZ
This is a multiple string. Values that contain lists or multiple 
values in human readable text are usually this type. Entries are separated
by NULL characters. For example, the following value entry specifies the 
binding rules for a network transport: 
   			   bindable : REG_MULTI_SZ : dlcDriver dlcDriver non non 50 

REG_SZ
This is a sequence of characters representing human readable text. 
For example, a component's description is usually this type: 
   			   DisplayName : REG_SZ : Messenger
